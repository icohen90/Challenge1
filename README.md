In this challenge I started with the index.html page. I started by replacing the header <div> tags with the <header> and <nav> tags. Then I moved on to the main content section
replacing the <div> tags with the <section> and <article> tags to make the code clearer. Then I noticed that the search engine optimization link wasn't working and that it was
missing an id with its corresponding id name. Also all of the images in this section were missin alt attributes so I added alt text for all of them. Then I moved on to the right 
hand column replacing the <div> tags with <section> and <article> tags to give the code more meaning. I also added empty alt attributes for the images so that if a screen reader
is used on the page it knows that those images don't have much meaning. Finally, I removed the <div> tag in the footer and replaced it with the <footer> tag. 

Then I moved on to the css page I added comments to the different sections also the main content styles seemed out of place so I reorganized them so that they are all together 
instead of separated.
